## Overview

**Default Flyout** | **ModernFlyouts**

![Overview](docs/images/Overview.png)

This application aims at providing a **Fluent Design System** based replacement for the old, built-in, **Metro Design** based **Audio/Airplane mode/Brightness** flyouts present in **Windows** *(they are not updated since Windows 8 LOL)* which are shown while pressing the media or volume keys or even the brightness keys *(may be absent on Desktop PCs)* or when airplane/flight mode is toggled.

This project has its roots on [AudioFlyout](https://github.com/ADeltaX/AudioFlyout) (made by [@ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/)). With additional implementation for **"Airplane mode"**, **"Brightness"** and **"LockKeys"** *(includes Insert key, Caps, Num & Scroll lock keys)* flyouts, this project stands as a complete replacement for the built-in one.

> Note : The built-in flyout will not be permanently affected. It will be hidden temporarily while this application is running. So, no reasons to fear breaking your system.
> For more information on how to recover the original flyouts, [check out this How To page](https://github.com/ShankarBUS/ModernFlyouts/wiki/How-To).

> Users are provided the freedom to choose between the Windows built-in flyouts or modern flyouts from ModernFlyouts or neither of them.

## NOTES

### Credits
First of all, we must thank our good friend **[@ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/)** for one of his marvelous works **"[AudioFlyout](https://github.com/ADeltaX/AudioFlyout)"**.

## Overview

**Default Flyout** | **ModernFlyouts**

![Overview](docs/images/Overview.png)

This application aims to provide a **Fluent Design System** based replacement for the old, built-in, **Metro Design** based **Audio/Airplane mode/Brightness** flyouts present in **Windows** *(which haven't been updated since Windows 8 LOL)* which are shown while pressing the media or volume keys or even the brightness keys *(may be absent on Desktop PCs)* or when airplane/flight mode is toggled.

This project has its roots in [AudioFlyout](https://github.com/ADeltaX/AudioFlyout) by [@ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/) with additional implementations for **"Airplane mode"**, **"Brightness"** and **"LockKeys"** *(includes Insert key, Caps, Num & Scroll lock keys)* flyouts. This project stands as a complete replacement for the built-in one.

> Note : The built-in flyout will not be permanently affected. It will be hidden temporarily while this application is running. So, no reason to fear breaking your system.
> For more information on how to recover the original flyouts, [check out this How To page](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/wiki/How-To).

> Users are provided the freedom to choose between the Windows built-in flyouts or modern flyouts from ModernFlyouts or neither of them.

> It is impossible to have a flyout for the keyboard backlight brightness or for the function (Fn) key because they are not passed as keys but as hardware signals (which the OEMs decide).  Any OS can receive those signals if they have the required driver.

## NOTES

### Credits

First of all, we must thank our good friend **[@ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/)** for one of his marvelous works **"[AudioFlyout](https://github.com/ADeltaX/AudioFlyout)"**. Since the project was stale for a while and it lacked support for brightness and airplane mode flyouts, this project was born. He not only let us use his source code but also helped us improve this app. And he still supports us üòÑ.
I must admit that this project wouldn't be here *how it is* without **[@ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/)**. Our heartful thanks to him ‚ù§.

Next, we must thank **[@riverar](https://github.com/riverar)** for accepting our invite and allowing us to integrate parts of [EarTrumpet](https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet) into ModernFlyouts.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Windows 10 20H2 or recent insider builds (recommended).
- At least 4 GB of RAM and x64 based CPU (recommended).
- (optional) Any git client such as [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
   - **GitHub Extension for Visual Studio** is enough for this project and is recommended for beginners.

### Visual Studio

Install latest VS2019 (stable or preview) from here: http://visualstudio.com/downloads

Include the following workloads:
- .NET desktop development
- MSIX Packaging Tools
- GitHub Extension for Visual Studio (recommended)

## Clone the repository

You can clone the repository using any git or GitHub Client of your choice.
You can even use Visual Studio's **Clone a repository** or GitHub's **Download Code as ZIP** feature.

After you have cloned the repository locally, open the **ModernFlyouts.sln** file on Visual Studio 2019.

## Building the project

Before building the project, please make sure setup your development environment properly and all dependency **Nuget Packages** are restored properly.

The **ModernFlyouts** project is the main one that contains all application source code. Just building that will be enough (dependencies will be pulled in automatically and included in the build process).

But what you really need to do is to build the **ModernFlyouts.Package** project. It's the project that packages the app and run it properly.

Before building the **ModernFlyouts.Package** project, please make sure to do these things:

- Open the **Package.appxmanifest** on the **ModernFlyouts.Package**.
- Under the **Application** tab, please change the **Display Name** from **ModernFlyouts (Preview)** to anything else such as **ModernFlyouts (Dev)**
    - This helps you to distinguish between the actual installation of **ModernFlyouts** and this test build.
- Now go to the **Packaging** tab.
- **!!!(Important)!!!** Please change the **Package name** from **32669SamG.ModernFlyouts** to something like **(YourName).ModernFlyouts** and the **Package display name** from **ModernFlyouts (Preview)** to **ModernFlyouts (Dev)**
    - This will prevent the actual installation of **ModernFlyouts** from being overwritten by this test build.
- Now click on the **Choose Certificate** button next to the **Publisher** textbox
    - On the **Choose a Certificate** dialog, you can either click on **Select from store** and click **Ok** on the next dialog. (or)
    - You can click on **Create**, type in your name on the next dialog and click **Ok**.

That's it! Now you can actually build the app!

**Important Note:** When committing changes to the repo, please make sure you don't include the changes to the **ModernFlyouts.Package.wapproj** and the **Package.appxmanifest** files.

## Running

Never run the **ModernFlyouts** project. It will run a dummy app with no support for app-data.
Please make sure run the **ModernFlyouts.Package** project! If you have ModernFlyouts pre-installed on your computer, please make sure to close it before running this one.
